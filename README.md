Created by __stornev__, 1/12/2021

I'm learning to code through Java and learning the basics of Computer Science!
Started in Python (self-taught + additionally in HS), but my HS switched to Java (AP CSA + self-taught).

I learned the syntax of Java and ported my knowledge from Python to Java.
I'm far too many weeks ahead in my class so, I decided to code more projects and learn more.
What my class covers:

| Unit                                  |        Time           |         Dates           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Primitive Types                       | 2.5 weeks or 8 hours  | 09/14/2020 - 09/21/2020 |
| Using Objects                         | 3 weeks or 13 hours   | 09/23/2020 - 10/09/2020 |
| Boolean Expressions and if Statements | 3 weeks or 13 hours   | 10/13/2020 - 11/06/2020 |
| Iteration                             | 4 weeks or 16 hours   | 11/09/2020 - 11/30/2020 |
| Magpie Lab                            | 3 hours               | 12/07/2020 - 12/07/2020 |
| Writing Classes                       | 3 weeks or 13 hours   | 12/09/2020 - 01/09/2020 |
| Array                                 | 2 weeks or 8 hours    | 01/13/2021 - 01/28/2021 |
| ArrayList                             | 2.5 weeks or 10 hours | 01/19/2021 - 02/05/2021 |
| 2D Array                              | 3 weeks or 13 hours   | 02/08/2021 - 03/05/2021 |
| Inheritance                           | 3 weeks or 13 hours   | 03/09/2021 - 03/26/2021 |
| Recursion                             | 1 week or 4 hours     | 03/29/2021 - 04/01/2021 |
| Exam Review                           | 2-4 weeks             | 04/12/2021 - 05/05/2021 |

I'm more than half-way done with unit 7, the rest of the class just started unit 6.
I already know how to do everything unit 8, 9, and 10 covers.
The only thing I'm still flaky on is recursion.

I've also done some of my own projects:
* Typeracer Web Scraper (for Race Data)
* Reading and Learning material in the HeadFirst Java book (on pg. 383)
* Up to day seven on AdventOfCode.com (I got stuck on 7 and didn't feel like continuing)

I want to make/create more, so that's why I'm here!
